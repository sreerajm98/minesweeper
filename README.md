# Instructions

## To play:

`python3 play.py n num_mines`<br />
<br />
`example: python3 play.py 5 3`<br />
This would start a game with a game with a 5 x 5 size board and 3 mines.

## To run the solver:

`python3 run_solver.py n num_mines trials`<br />
<br />
`example: python3 run_solver.py 5 3 100`<br />
This would run the solver on a 5 x 5 board with 3 mines over 100 trials.<br />
You could also use `python3 run_solver.py` for the default setting of n = 10, num_mines = 10, trials = 100,000

## To test:
`python3 solver_test.py -v`
